    <p>The tag that I've learned at the first is strong. strong tag makes a words bold.The second tag is from h1 to h6.They control pont size.
    The third tag is br and p. The br tag is only used when we want to enter. The p tag is used what we want to express some paragraph.
    The fourth tag is putting some images. It is img src="image file name". If you want to control a size, add to width="number".Recomend the site called unsplash for free picture.
    The sixth tag li is used for contesnts. li is child and ul is parent. ul is unordered line and ol is ordered line such a 1,2,3.
    The seventh tags are top3 of all. head and body < html < !doctype html</p>
    <p>When you want to put some <a target="_blank" href="https://www.opentutorials.org/" title="Opentutorials.org">link on the sentens</a>, you can use a of anchor.
